			 <ol> If it continues, global warming will eventually make life on earth unlivable for us human beings, because of the extreme extremely scorching temperatures</ol>
			 
			 <ol> Global Warming will make the ozone layer disappear completely, so we will all be dead when that happens</ol>

			  <ul> Smog, half smoke and half fog, causes pollution and the trees stop cleaning the air for us to breathe </ul>

			  <body> When the air is polluted or has bad air quality, it is because of the smog, that makes global warming </body>
			  
			  <body> Trees clean the air and make it breathable, but they stop cleaning the air when smoke and fog make smog </body>

			   <h7> The problem is that the earth will no longer be liveable because of global warming taking place </h7>
			 
			   <h8> The solution is to make it aware to other people, and make sure that they use hydrogen or electric vehicles </h8>
			   
			   <h9> The action is that we should stop using gasoline vehicles, and walk or bike as transportation to destination </h9>
			   
			   <p> Global warming is when even in the winter, when it is supposed to be cold, it is warmer, and even in the spring and fall, when it is supposed to be cooler, the temperature is rising above average </p>
